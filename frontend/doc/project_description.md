# Zero To Hundred

This is a memecoin platform, where users can create and buy/sell memecoins.
 
Users can earn ZTH (the platform's native currency) by creating memecoins, strategically buying trending coins, and selling them at optimal times. A user's ZTH balance serves as their score on the platform's leaderboard.

> This wil be a reference implementation for a student project. The project specification and the technologies used are part of what they have to learn. Every student will have to develop their own whole project and will not have access to the code of this repository.

While the website and features will be looking like a web3 project, everything will happen offchain. It is a training project for students, and blockchain is not in the list of skills to learn. 
All the token system and transactions will be handled by the server in a relational database. 

The code of the application should be of a good quality, but not too difficult to understand, so parts of it can be shown to students. 
It is not needed to handle complex edge cases and security protections. 

# Features

## Users

Users can signup to the platform, see all the existing memecoins, all users profiles, see the memecoins they own in their wallet and create a memecoin.

Users can edit a public profile page, containing a username, a profile picture, a banner, a description and some other funny things like customizing the look of their page (background color, text color ...). 

Their profile should be randomly generated at signup with:
- A random username following a fun pattern (e.g., "CryptoKitten42", "MoonLambo99")
- A randomly selected profile picture from a predefined set of meme-themed avatars
- Random banner from a set of crypto-themed banners
- Default color scheme from a predefined set of themes

The page should show stats about the user, like their balances, number of trades, metrics about their trading performances including:
- Total profit/loss in ZTH
- Best performing trade
- Number of different memecoins traded
- Average holding time
- Trading frequency (trades per day)

At onboarding, explain shortly but clearly what the users can do, then propose them to create a memecoin or see the existing meme coins. The onboarding flow should:
1. Welcome screen with platform explanation
2. Quick tutorial on how trading works
3. Explanation of the initial 100 ZTH balance
4. Guide to creating first memecoin or making first trade

## Memecoins

Memecoins are coins created by users. 

Each memecoins has:
- Name (3-20 characters, alphanumeric)
- Ticker (2-5 characters, uppercase letters only)
- Description (max 500 characters)
- Logo (square image, max 1MB, supported formats: PNG, JPG, GIF)
- Creation timestamp
- Creator

ZTH is not a memecoin, it is stored as a value for a user. 
When a user signup, it gets 100 ZTH.

## Wallets

Each user has a single wallet that can hold multiple types of memecoins. The wallet tracks the balance of each memecoin type the user owns.

## Trading Mechanism

The platform implements an automated market maker system using a bonding curve model for each memecoin. This creates a self-sustaining economy where price is determined by supply and demand without requiring traditional order books.

### Bonding Curve Mechanics
1. Creation: When a user creates a new memecoin, they define its basic properties (name, ticker, description, logo). Creation costs 1 ZTH to prevent spam creation of memecoins.

2. Price Determination: Each memecoin's price is determined by a mathematical bonding curve function that establishes a relationship between the coin's supply and its price.
- As more tokens are purchased (supply increases), the price rises
- As tokens are sold back (supply decreases), the price falls
- The specific curve formula will be a simple polynomial function: Price = (Supply)Â²/10000

3. Reserve Pool: When users buy a memecoin, their ZTH payment goes into a reserve pool specific to that memecoin. This reserve serves as the liquidity source to pay users who sell their tokens.
- The reserve pool is always sufficient to buy back all existing tokens at their respective prices according to the bonding curve
- The system maintains this mathematical relationship automatically

4. Buying Process:
- When a user buys a memecoin, they specify the amount of ZTH they want to spend
- The system calculates how many tokens they receive based on the current position on the bonding curve
- The price per token increases slightly with each purchase
- The spent ZTH enters the memecoin's reserve pool

5. Selling Process:
- When a user sells a memecoin, they specify the number of tokens they want to sell
- The system calculates the ZTH they receive based on the current position on the bonding curve
- The price per token decreases slightly with each sale
- The received ZTH comes from the memecoin's reserve pool

6. No Transaction Fees: To keep the system simple, there are no transaction fees for buying or selling memecoins. The only "cost" is the natural slippage that occurs when trading on the bonding curve.
7. Market Sentiment: The platform calculates and displays market sentiment for each memecoin based on recent trading activity:
- Positive: More buys than sells in the last 24 hours
- Neutral: Roughly equal buys and sells
- Negative: More sells than buys in the last 24 hours

8. Trading Volume: The platform tracks and displays the total ZTH volume traded for each memecoin over various time periods (24h, 7d, 30d).
This bonding curve model creates a simple yet engaging economic system where early adopters of popular memecoins can profit as more users buy in, while ensuring there's always liquidity for sellers. The mechanism encourages strategic thinking about when to buy and sell different memecoins, adding depth to the gameplay without requiring complex trading knowledge.

9. Handling price changes
When a user asks to buy or sell a token, the price can change between the time it saw the price and the moment the transaction is executed. A slippage tolerance must be provided to either accept or reject the trade at execution time. 

The default slippage tolerance should be 1%, but users can adjust this between 0.1% and 5% for each trade.

10. Trade Execution
For each trade:
- Show estimated output amount based on current price
- Display price impact percentage
- Show minimum amount to be received (with slippage)
- Require confirmation for trades with high price impact (>5%)
- Show transaction preview before confirmation

# General technical specifications

Error handling must be properly done, like API error, input validation, both in the frontend and in the backend.

All of the data must be accessible with a REST API, but things like token price should be updated regularly on the frontend. (no websocket)
- Price updates every 5 seconds
- Trading volume updates every minute
- Market sentiment updates every 5 minutes

All parts of the app must run inside docker containers, be easily deployable to a cloud.
The whole app should be easilly locally runnable via docker compose. 

We don't consider backup management, the project will be run locally. 
There should be a github action to build the necessary containers.
