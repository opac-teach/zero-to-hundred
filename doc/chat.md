I wrote a specification for a project I want to build. Please read it and analyse it. 
- Is it missing some things ?
- Are some part not clear enough ?
- Maybe some part can be rephrased to be more clear ?

In the file doc/specifications.md, describle technically:
- Data Models
- API Endpoints

Elaborate a plan for building the app. 
I will not code anything myself, so provide step by step instructions to build the app from start to complete. 
Do not include code, or command, just instructions.

@doc do step X.X of the plan
